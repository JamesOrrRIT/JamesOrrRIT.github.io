                the Rochester Institute of Technology was 'Reach for the Stars'. A simple modification of the 'Circle Blast' game programmed 
                as an earlier exercise, this simple Javascript game provides a rudamentary space shooter with fifteen levels, sound effects, 
                and a few additional ways to change how to play it, it's not one of my proudest projects, but it was one of my first experiences 
                with an interactive coding project.</p>

                <p>As part of the <b>IGME 330 Rich Media Web App Development</b> Class, we were instructed to use the Canvas API to 
                create a phyllotaxis spiral using an algorithm in Javascript. The above picture is the result of one of the
                generated patterns. The instructions were to generate this algorithm to work with buttons that would pause / resume 
                and restart the pattern and a seperate button to export the current state of the canvas to an image file. We were
                told to be creative with the projects, so I provided five different options for colors that generate in different ways.</p>

                <p>One other project for the <b>IGME 330</b> class as mentioned above was to create an audio visualizer assignment that read
                music using Javascript and convert that music into data that would update on a Canvas. The style of the visualizer was up
                to us to decide, so I provided three different options in a record player, a disco party, and a seismograph as seen in the provided
                images. I also applied other functions to the tool from previous audio visualizer assignments such as generating noise and being able
                toggle the color, disable certain aspects of the visualizer, alter the color scheme, and impact the base and treble of the music.

                <p>As part of the <b>IGME 420 Level Design</b> class, three major projects were to apply the concepts we've learned throughout the semester and
                create levels in various genres using those concepts. The games provided were 2D platformer <b>Battleblock Theater</b>, puzzle-platformer
                <b>Portal 2</b>, and a first person shooter of our choice, my choice being <b>Quake</b>. The very last project was to choose our favorite level we 
                made and provide audio commentary and what we enjoyed while making it and what we would do to improve the level in the future.</p>
                <div class="ml-5 mr-5" id="levelDesignShowcase">

                        <div class="column">
                            <p>The major aspects we were tasked with applying for the Battleblock Theater level were to get a general feel for the present mechanics
                            of the game and then apply them with principles of level flow. The main aspect of the levels are to collect 3 of the 7 gems to unlock the exit,
                            with optional goals of finding a hidden yarnball and finishing in a time limit. I wanted to change up the formula for the level by giving the 
                            player three different directions to the gems with unique aspects of Battleblock's design philosophy. The left leads to tight platforming, the right
                            to enemy combat, and the top with being an instance of precision platforming with other obstacles. The level was created from a basic sketch, then to
                            a playable prototype, and then critiqued with peers from the class for the final version playable on the Steam Workshop right now.

                            <p>The level designed for Portal 2 was meant to exemplify it's puzzle aspects and the natural flow of the mechanics as it was introduced to the player.
                            We were to take an element from the game and then design a level chamber around that mechanic in a three step process; introduce the mechanics to the player
                            at the start with a simple task, reinforce the task by providing an expansion to the first puzzle, and then apply a twist to the mechanic that makes use of it
                            in a different way. The mechanic I chose was the Redirection Cube that points laser beams in different direction and activates mechanisms. The original
                            version was to be three seperate levels that cater to each of the steps with a theme of bringing the redirection cube with you and making use of it throughout,
                            hence the 'Take Me With You' name which would be followed by 'Take Me Too' which would use a second cube, and 'Take Me Back' which would end with the player losing
                            the cube. I would've loved to expand the level into this idea, but I eventually combined certain elements to make one chamber for both simplicity and time.

                            <p>The last level to create was for a first person shooter of our choice, of which I would have chosen the original Doom if it met the proper requirments, so I settled
                            with Quake instead. We needed to design the level using tools that would make it a viable level from both a gameplay standpoint as well as a visual standpoint. Environmental
                            storytelling was the aspect we needed to make use of, so I designed the original level as starting within a temple and fighting your way out towards an enemy encampment.
                            This level was easily the most difficult to create as I worked with Trenchbroom, an external level designing tool as opposed to the internal tools of the previous two projects.
                            It was diffcult to understand how Trenchbroom worked with it's own components and make the level feel authentic while keeping the original vision intact. Though it was a challenge
                            to make, I feel as though it was a solid attempt at capturing the idea and making good use of mechanics like hidden walls to keep the experience interesting.

                <p>The culmination of my work for the <b>IGME 529 Foundation of Interactive Narrative</b> class is in the story 'Don't Push Your Luck'.
                The requirments combined several storytelling techniques learned throughout the semester added to a story that would be told
                through three acts that would express character development and reactions. My story is about two roommates who can see the future
                and read minds respectively who attempt to keep their secrets from each other when betting goes too far. While rudamentary in interactive
                elements, I'm still happy with the way that this project turned out, especially with handling Twine to create all the transitions and sound effects.

                I worked alongside others to model, texture, and animate several of the assets used in the game, which I created with Blender. The
