                <p>As part of the IGME 330 Rich Media Web App Development Class, we were instructed to use the Canvas API to 
                create a phyllotaxis spiral using an algorithm in Javascript. The above picture is the result of one of the
                generated patterns. The instructions were to generate this algorithm to work with buttons that would pause / resume 
                and restart the pattern and a seperate button to export the current state of the canvas to an image file. We were
                told to be creative with the projects, so I provided five different options for colors that generate in different ways.</p>

                <p>One of the projects for the IGME 330 class as mentioned above was to create an audio visualizer assignment that read
                music using Javascript and convert that music into data that would update on a Canvas. The style of the visualizer was up
                to us to decide, so I provided three different options in a record player, a disco party, and a seismograph as seen in the provided
                images. I also applied other functions to the tool from previous audio visualizer assignments such as generating noise and being able
                toggle the color, disable certain aspects of the visualizer, alter the color scheme, and impact the base and treble of the music.

                <p>In the Summer of 2022, I was brought on board as a 3D Asset Designer for Changeling, a virtual reality narrative experience. 
                I worked alongside others to model, texture, and animate several of the assets used in the game, which I created with Blender. The 
                above images are some of the items that I created for the project, taking what I've learned from previous asset design classes and 
                applying those skills professionally. It was not only my first experience working professionally with others in the field, but a 
                learning experience into 3D Asset Design process and import
