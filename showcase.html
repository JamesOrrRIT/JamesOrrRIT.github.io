                <p>One of the first major projects I put out was my final project for the <b>IGME 235 Intro To Web Technology</b> class at
                the Rochester Institute of Technology was 'Reach for the Stars'. A simple modification of the 'Circle Blast' game programmed 
                as an earlier exercise, this simple Javascript game provides a rudamentary space shooter with fifteen levels, sound effects, 
                and a few additional ways to change how to play it, it's not one of my proudest projects, but it was one of my first experiences 
                with an interactive coding project.</p>

                <p>As part of the <b>IGME 330 Rich Media Web App Development</b> Class, we were instructed to use the Canvas API to 
                create a phyllotaxis spiral using an algorithm in Javascript. The above picture is the result of one of the
                generated patterns. The instructions were to generate this algorithm to work with buttons that would pause / resume 
                and restart the pattern and a seperate button to export the current state of the canvas to an image file. We were
                told to be creative with the projects, so I provided five different options for colors that generate in different ways.</p>

                <p>One other project for the <b>IGME 330</b> class as mentioned above was to create an audio visualizer assignment that read
                music using Javascript and convert that music into data that would update on a Canvas. The style of the visualizer was up
                to us to decide, so I provided three different options in a record player, a disco party, and a seismograph as seen in the provided
                images. I also applied other functions to the tool from previous audio visualizer assignments such as generating noise and being able
                toggle the color, disable certain aspects of the visualizer, alter the color scheme, and impact the base and treble of the music.

                <p>The culmination of my work for the <b>IGME 529 Foundation of Interactive Narrative</b> class is in the story 'Don't Push Your Luck'.
                The requirments combined several storytelling techniques learned throughout the semester added to a story that would be told
                through three acts that would express character development and reactions. My story is about two roommates who can see the future
                and read minds respectively who attempt to keep their secrets from each other when betting goes too far. While rudamentary in interactive
                elements, I'm still happy with the way that this project turned out, especially with handling Twine to create all the transitions and sound effects.

                <p>In the Summer of 2022, I was brought on board as a 3D Asset Designer for <b>Changeling</b>, a virtual reality narrative experience. 
                I worked alongside others to model, texture, and animate several of the assets used in the game, which I created with Blender. The 
                above images are some of the items that I created for the project, taking what I've learned from previous asset design classes and 
                applying those skills professionally. It was not only my first experience working professionally with others in the field, but a 
                learning experience into 3D Asset Design process and import

                <p>The above works were created using <b>Adobe Photoshop 2022</b> as I was testing out the software when creating backgrounds for my phone and 
                desktop. The first image represents a small system of planets created by taking small image textures and then warping them into a spherical
                shape, along with noise effects to generate the stars and space dust before adding a lens flare for added effect. The second is of a starlit
                night at a beach that has a series of comets and a shot of the moon, with the water ripples being made with a custom imported brush and noise
                being used to create the sand. The third was an earlier test made just to test out cloud brushes and a gradient with the sky, as well as testing
                out mirror brushing to make the symbols on the pillars.</p>
