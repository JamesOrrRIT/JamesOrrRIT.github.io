                <p>One of the first major projects I put out was my final project for the <b>IGME 235 Intro To Web Technology</b> class at
                the Rochester Institute of Technology was 'Reach for the Stars'. A simple modification of the 'Circle Blast' game programmed 
                as an earlier exercise, this simple Javascript game provides a rudamentary space shooter with fifteen levels, sound effects, 
                and a few additional ways to change how to play it, it's not one of my proudest projects, but it was one of my first experiences 
                with an interactive coding project.</p>

                            generated patterns. The instructions were to generate this algorithm to work with buttons that would pause / resume

                <p>One other project for the <b>IGME 330</b> class as mentioned above was to create an audio visualizer assignment that read
                music using Javascript and convert that music into data that would update on a Canvas. The style of the visualizer was up
                to us to decide, so I provided three different options in a record player, a disco party, and a seismograph as seen in the provided
                images. I also applied other functions to the tool from previous audio visualizer assignments such as generating noise and being able
                toggle the color, disable certain aspects of the visualizer, alter the color scheme, and impact the base and treble of the music.

                <p>As part of the <b>IGME 420 Level Design</b> class, three major projects were to apply the concepts we've learned throughout the semester and
                create levels in various genres using those concepts. The games provided were 2D platformer <b>Battleblock Theater</b>, puzzle-platformer
                <b>Portal 2</b>, and a first person shooter of our choice, my choice being <b>Quake</b>. The very last project was to choose our favorite level we 
                made and provide audio commentary and what we enjoyed while making it and what we would do to improve the level in the future.</p>

                            <p>The major aspects we were tasked with applying for the Battleblock Theater level were to get a general feel for the present mechanics
                            of the game and then apply them with principles of level flow. The main aspect of the levels are to collect 3 of the 7 gems to unlock the exit,
                            with optional goals of finding a hidden yarnball and finishing in a time limit. I wanted to change up the formula for the level by giving the 
                            player three different directions to the gems with unique aspects of Battleblock's design philosophy. The left leads to tight platforming, the right
                            to enemy combat, and the top with being an instance of precision platforming with other obstacles. The level was created from a basic sketch, then to
                            a playable prototype, and then critiqued with peers from the class for the final version playable on the Steam Workshop right now. The provided video 
                            demonstrates the finished version as well as a playthrough of the original.

                            <p>The level designed for Portal 2 was meant to exemplify it's puzzle aspects and the natural flow of the mechanics as it was introduced to the player.
                            We were to take an element from the game and then design a level chamber around that mechanic in a three step process; introduce the mechanics to the player
                            at the start with a simple task, reinforce the task by providing an expansion to the first puzzle, and then apply a twist to the mechanic that makes use of it
                            in a different way. The mechanic I chose was the Redirection Cube that points laser beams in different direction and activates mechanisms. The original
                            version was to be three seperate levels that cater to each of the steps with a theme of bringing the redirection cube with you and making use of it throughout,
                            hence the 'Take Me With You' name which would be followed by 'Take Me Too' which would use a second cube, and 'Take Me Back' which would end with the player losing
                            the cube. I would've loved to expand the level into this idea, but I eventually combined certain elements to make one chamber for both simplicity and time.

                        <div class="column">
                            <p>The last level to create was for a first person shooter of our choice, of which I would have chosen the original Doom if it met the proper requirments, so I settled
                            with Quake instead. We needed to design the level using tools that would make it a viable level from both a gameplay standpoint as well as a visual standpoint. Environmental
                            storytelling was the aspect we needed to make use of, so I designed the original level as starting within a temple and fighting your way out towards an enemy encampment.
                            This level was easily the most difficult to create as I worked with Trenchbroom, an external level designing tool as opposed to the internal tools of the previous two projects.
                            It was diffcult to understand how Trenchbroom worked with it's own components and make the level feel authentic while keeping the original vision intact. Though it was a challenge
                            to make, I feel as though it was a solid attempt at capturing the idea and making good use of mechanics like hidden walls to keep the experience interesting.

                The requirments combined several storytelling techniques learned throughout the semester added to a story that would be told
                through three acts that would express character development and reactions. My story is about two roommates who can see the future
                and read minds respectively who attempt to keep their secrets from each other when betting goes too far. While rudamentary in interactive
                elements, I'm still happy with the way that this project turned out, especially with handling Twine to create all the transitions and sound effects.

                            <p>This is one of the first builds of the game while it was early in development. The main goal of this build was to get the main controls

                            was still getting the level geometry down.

                <p>Sort Circuit is an upcoming arcade platforming game created in Gamemaker Studio 2. In a world where electrical appliances are powered by little creatures called Sparks,
                    the player takes on the role of an employee of Recharge LLC. As workers of the company, they must carry Sparks to collectors to recharge them while navigating around 
                    obstacles and enemies.

                            <p>This update has several additions to the game from the first snapshot. First and foremost is the second playable character, Magnette, who instead of jumping like Volt
                                to handle platforming, instead flips her own gravity to float directly up and down. The following characters will also have unique controls and way to change up how they
                                accomplish the gameplay loop of bringing Sparks to the Collectors. On that note with the Collectors, I realized that with a game about sorting objects by color, there would need to be a 
                                <b>Colorblind</b> mode, so I edited the sprites to account for the toggle to include distinguisable shapes on both the Sparks and Collectors to differentiate them. Lastly is an
                                update to the games graphics, with the checkerboard pattern used to define walls being replaced with a new tileset to fit more in line with the factory theme of this
                                first set of levels.

                being used to create the sand. The third was an earlier test made just to test out cloud brushes and a gradient with the sky, as well as testing
                out mirror brushing to make the symbols on the pillars.</p>

                reccurent viewer, and soon propsed to help out as a channel artist, with my main contribution being Solstice's PNGTuber. Solstice came up with
                the idea for the design before I drew the images used for the model in Adobe Photoshop, as well as searching for tutorials to set up the PNGTuber
                in OBS. Recently I contributed another piece for the channel in the form of the 'Starting Soon' screen, which I made by creating sprites based on
                the PNGTuber, and creating the assets, shaders, and animations in Blender.
