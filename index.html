            <h1 class="is-size-3 has-text-weight-bold has-text-centered">Hello. My name is James Orr.</h1>
            <h4 class="is-size-3 has-text-weight-bold">About Me</h4>
            <p>For as long as I can remember, I have been an avid fan of playing video games. I felt that they could be utilized as an
            effective tool for both artists and storytellers to provide enjoyable interactive experiences that can be enjoyed by the masses.
            That is why I have worked hard to pursue a career in the field of Game Design and Development that I have achieved as a graduate
            of the Rochester Institute of Technology. I hope to use the skills that I have acquired throughout my education and combine those
            with the stories that I want to tell and the art I want to create to not only allow others to have fun playing, but to be inspired
            to create and tell the stories they want.
            </p>

            <h4 class="is-size-3 has-text-weight-bold">My Skills</h4>
            <p>Throughout my academic career, both before and during my time with RIT, I have worked alongside many others who are so passionate
            about this field like myself. I have gained experience in numerous fields associated with game design including:
            <ul>
                <li>College level programming classes teaching C, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li>
                <li>Experience in 2D and 3D art software including Autodesk Maya, Blender, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro</li>
                <li>Various classes throughout fields of level design, networking, asset design and animation, and storytelling</li>
                <li>Assumed leadership roles both in person and remote</li>
                <li>Worked diligently in meeting strict deadlines with quality products</li>
                <li>Experience handling pushes and changes made via Github and other data sharing systems</li>
            </ul>
            The very website that you are looking at right now was programmed by myself in Visual Studio, with formatting provided by 
            <b><a hre="https://bulma.io">Bulma</a></b>, an open source tool to assist in handling the transition from desktop to mobile viewing, all
            shown and presentable via <b><a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a></b>. I work around the clock making art either to challenge 
            myself to learn new skills or just for the fun of doing so. I'm always willing to learn something new and push myself out there in order to constantly improve.
            </p>

            <h4 class="is-size-3 has-text-weight-bold">My Projects</h4>
            <p> Several of my projects and work are visible on the <b><a href="showcase.html">Showcase</a></b> page, alongside detailed descriptions of
            each, links where applicable, and even breakdown documents that detailed my design process and philosophies. I am also constantly updating
            the page to showcase new materials whenever I can.
