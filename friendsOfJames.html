                <td>All probabilities are set to 0</td>
                <td>'Spilled Salt' was originally 'Broken Mirror', but I thought that would conflict with the existing 'Glass Joker'. Both are attributed to bad luck or misfortune, which lead to it's usage of negating luck based effects from occurring.</td>

                <td>Kerosene</td>
                <td>1.5X Mult, destroys itself and a random Joker if the score catches fire</td>
                <td>Kerosene is a flammable liquid used as fuel for light and power. It's ability to combust and destroy itself and another Joker is based on how the players score will light up with a fire effect if the current hand can beat the required score in one hand.</td>

                <td>Bonus and Mult cards will activate each others effect</td>
                <td>A 'big earner' is defined as someone who makes a lot of money, which I translated to the Bonus and Mult cards that increase score by +30 Chips and +4 Mult respectively.</td>

                <td>Levels up the next three played hands</td>
                <td>The idea was to create a food joker (which provide a limited effect until they expire) to a Joker that levels up played hands. The choice of a Pomegranete is a reference to the game Hades by Supergiant Games.</td>

                <td>Earn between $2 and $5 when skipping a Booster Pack</td>
                <td>Similar to 'Red Card' giving mult when skipping Booster Packs, Reciept focuses on money, such as when getting a refund from an unsatisfactory product.</td>
